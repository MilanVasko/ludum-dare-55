DEMON:
Oh, hi! You must be human. I didn't expected the ritual to work.

YOU:
Where am I? What the hell just happened?

DEMON: 
You answered yourself. But calling this place Hell is rude, we don't use it anymore.

YOU:
What?!

DEMON:
Alright, I will try it slowly. You are in Demon Realm. We accidentally summoned you using this Human Summoning.

YOU:
That's... Advanced Algebra 4?

DEMON:
Human summoning. Anyways somewhere around here should be pamphlet that could help you. I saw it in the other room.
