CAT:
Whoa, a Catnip! Now that's some good material.

YOU:
Uhm... Kitty-Kitty-Kitty?

CAT:
Oh! A human! Wait... that's MY human!

YOU:
Daisy?

CAT:
Yes, my human! How did you get here?

YOU:
Well... Advanced Algebra, I assume?

CAT:
Classic.

YOU:
I need you to get me back, can you do that?

CAT:
I can!

YOU:
Great so how do we...

CAT:
But first, I would like to have a fish. Go get me some fish, human.

YOU:
... Cats.
